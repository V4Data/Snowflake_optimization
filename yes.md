# Snowflake Materialized Views: Boost Query Performance

Materialized Views in Snowflake precompute and store expensive query results, enabling lightning-fast retrieval for frequently run queries.

## Why use materialized views?

- **Dramatically reduced query runtime**  
  Retrieve precomputed results instantly to avoid repeating costly calculations.

- **Automatic incremental refresh**  
  Snowflake updates materialized views automatically as base data changes, keeping results current with minimal manual effort.

- **Ideal for stable data**  
  Best suited for datasets that don’t change frequently to keep refresh costs low.

## Best Practices

- **Focus on high-impact queries**  
  Materialize queries that run often and demand high compute resources like joins and aggregations.

- **Filter and limit columns**  
  Include only necessary data to keep storage and refresh costs manageable.

- **Monitor cost vs. benefit**  
  Evaluate regularly if performance gains outweigh the costs of storage and maintenance.

- **Ensure proper permissions**  
  Grant `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` privilege on the schema and `SELECT` privilege on base tables to the appropriate roles.

## Example Queries

### Create a materialized view for department salary aggregation:

```

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW emp_salary_mv AS
SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

```

### Query the materialized view:

```

SELECT * FROM emp_salary_mv;

```

### Check refresh history of materialized views:

```

SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.MATERIALIZED_VIEW_REFRESH_HISTORY())
WHERE MATERIALIZED_VIEW_NAME = 'EMP_SALARY_MV'
ORDER BY LAST_REFRESH_TIME DESC;

```

### Grant necessary permissions:

```

GRANT CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ON SCHEMA my_schema TO ROLE my_role;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE employees TO ROLE my_role;

```

## Measuring Success

- **Track query speed and credit use**  
  Compare the runtime and compute credits consumed before and after using materialized views.

- **Consider refresh and storage costs**  
  Account for ongoing compute required for incremental refreshes and storage of precomputed data.

- **Optimize based on usage patterns**  
  Materialized views perform best for frequently run queries on moderately stable data.
